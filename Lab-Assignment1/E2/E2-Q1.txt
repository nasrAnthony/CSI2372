Lab 1 Exercise 2:
Q1:
Main will begin by initializing 4 variables. 
Then it will then launch a while loop with a condition of 1 
that will continiously run. Within the loop, the variable choice
is given the value returned from the menu() function. 
Then a switch case statement will help prompt the user for the measurements (raduis, height etc...)
before calling the appropriate function for calculating the surface or volume. 
Finally,the result is printed out to the user. If '3' is given, program stops.
